                <p>laff is an app that helps users find jokes based on specific key words determined by the user. The
                    goal of the app is for users to broaden their comedic tastes, while also contributing to the jokes
                    people can see. The app also features a social platform where users can follow others and rate their
                    jokes.

                <p>As a fan of comedy I inquired more about their expectations of what this app could be, as well as
                    questions about the kind of comedy they enjoy. I wanted to get deeper insights as to what they were
                    looking for in this app to make them funnier. I wanted to understand what they find funny, how they
                    gow about finding things that they find funny, how their sense of humour is, and how they would plan
                    to use this app.
                    After a 15 minute user interview, I highlighted the answers that stood out the most to me.

                                    up, or I’m
                                    planning something. Like if I’m going to Louisiana and I want to make a joke, I can
                                    think of it
                                    ahead of time.</p>

                                    on ... you can
                                    make a joke based on that. Its situational, its comedic. Or you’re in a discussion
                                    with friends that
                                    you think of a random pun and be more quick witted.</p>

                                <p>I feel like that [the option for users to submit their own jokes] could be a separate
                                    thing, but I
                                    don’t think the app should solely be based on that, I feel like it should have a
                                    database. I think
                                    the jokes should also have a flag option in case people feel it’s offensive, and add
                                    “what don’t
                                    they like about the joke”.</p>

                                <p>I would love [the app feeding me a new joke on a daily basis]. My horoscope app gives

                                    update on what it thinks is going on in my life and I love it. Especially for

                                    high way, freeway, and road. What I think the app should have is like when you
                                    search corn, it’ll
                                    give you results for maize, like a-maize-ing. I would just like google synonyms for
                                    the word.</p>
